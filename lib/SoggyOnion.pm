=head1 NAME

SoggyOnion - RSS and other arbitrary content aggregatron

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ soggyonion-install
    $ vim/emacs config.yaml
    $ soggyonion config.yaml
    $ crontab -e

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE:> This is a pre-release. I need to add tests, among other things. Functionality is here, though.

SoggyOnion is an RSS and arbitrary content aggregator that produces static
pages. It was written to be easily installable and configurable as well as
trivial to extend. It is meant for people that want to view RSS feeds and other
scraped content as a web page and want minimal setup and configuration.

See the defaults in action at: L<http://soggyonion.com/>

=head2 Installation

The module creates two executables, F<soggyonion> and
F<soggyonion-install>. Once the SoggyOnion module is installed, do the
following:

=over 4

=item 1. Change to a directory where you'd like to keep the configuration
file and defaults, then run the F<soggyonion-install> command. This will
extract a handful of files to the current directory.

=item 2. Edit the F<config.yaml> configuration file. To get started
quickly, just make sure the four options in the first section are
correct.

=item 3. Run the F<soggyonion> command with th

=back

=head2 Customizing the Output

All sources of content are found in the F<config.yaml> file. The main
template, F<templates/main.tt2>, contains all the CSS. 

=head2 Extending

See: L<SoggyOnion::Plugin>

=head2 Why is it called "SoggyOnion?"

I purchased the domain C<csoggyonion.com> on complete impulse. When
I wrote this I finally made use of that silly domain and I kept the
name.

=head2 Why don't I use (RSS utility here)?

If you like it better, please do. I welcome all suggestions and
constructive criticism (a.k.a. complaints), so fire away :-)

I wanted a tool where I could specify a few sources of RSS/RDF and have
it produce categorized, static pages for me that could be easily
customized through templates and CSS. I'm also not yet convinced that
everything should be RSS -- SoggyOnion can be used as a front-end for
any scraped content.
